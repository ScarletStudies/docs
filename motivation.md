## Pay Walled Study Sites

StudyBlue and its ilk are greedy corporate products preying on students. Content is locked up, requiring signups and outrageous payments to access content _created by other students, for free_. Sites like these pollute web search results for course content and course aid.

To this end, scarlet studies is committed to user freedom. The entire application is licensed AGPLv3+, meaning that users never have to worry about the application being "locked up." The content is free and will remain free. This is guaranteed by the API, providing unlimited access - scrape away (but don't cause service disruptions - the service is meant to cost very little to run/maintain).

## Fragmentation

Students in a course are fragmented by time, in the sense that previous semesters content and students have no organized contact with each other. This is regrettable, for I see students trading or selling previous semesters exams/homework solutions. Students are fragmented by sections, capping the reach of groups. Finally, students are fragmented within sections by disparate messaging and communication platforms.

Instead of fragmentation, centralization! All courses are listed on scarlet studies, meaning students do not have to make direct outreach to each other in order to organize. Sign up here, tell your friends to sign up here.

Previous semesters content will also be kept available, forever. It is tagged by semester, allowing easy search of the content being sought.

## Student Managed

University managed/own/partnered software has an implicit or explicit social contract: play nice, or else!

While you will have to play nice on scarlet studies due use of your student email, you are otherwise free to post critiques of classes, share homework answers, and even share free textbook/pdf links.

There is the issue of professors or administrators joining the site. And I do not know the correct approach to this, but for now every online user should remember that once content is posted under your name, it will probably never be deleted. So while the site will not delete your content by orders of a professor or administrator, please keep your comments respectful.

This may or may not become a larger issue. Please note that it is a topic deeply cared about by the core developer.
