# Scarlet Studies

## Documentation

This repo serves as a basis for issues and documentation for the project as-a-whole.

## Application Setup

The frontend is an Angular web application. It should run in modern browsers. Communication with the backend occurs through "REST"-like HTTP requests, authenticated using JSON web tokens. The backend persists data in a MySQL database. The backend and frontend are both hosted using docker.
